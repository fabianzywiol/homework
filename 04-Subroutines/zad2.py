# In addition to the built-in functions, you can use numerous functions available in ready-to-use modules. One example is the 'math' module.

# Using functions and constants available in the 'math' module, write a program that calculates and displays:

import math

# a. natural logarithm of 5
print(math.log(5))

# b. e raised to the powe of 3
print(math.exp(3))

# c. square root of 7
print(math.sqrt(7))

# d. sine of 90 degrees
math.sin(math.radians(90))
